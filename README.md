アーク (The Ark): My *nix dotfiles

### Contents

- Vim
- Tmux
- Zsh (Prezto)
- Git

### Installation

1. Download the repo or use Git `git clone https://github.com/aasare/aaku`
2. Run the installation script in the repo `cd aaku && ./install`

### Usage

- I use [Dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot) to bootrap the files
together. It requires Python to be installed which comes with most of Linux
distributions.
- Running the installation script will run antoher script `requirements`. This is
the script that installs the required packages. It currently works for Ubuntu based
systems. To use it with another system, you'll need to install each package manually
or write another script.
